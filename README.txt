My first ever game jam, my chalenge is to:
-> make something and publish it on time 
-> make it in C++ with SFML
-> make my "game" kind of open source via git and github

I am going to use:
-> Game assets from https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1,
-> Font from https://www.fontspace.com/pixel-combat-font-f21503,
-> Music from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XglPmrs4xw0,
